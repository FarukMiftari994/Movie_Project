The "Movie World" - Project is a website made with React, Bootstrap, Firebase, and a movie API. Users can sign up and explore more features. They can easily check out the latest movies and popular ones too, thanks to the movie API. When users sign in, they can make their own list of favourite movies. They can add or remove movies whenever they want. And with Firebase, user logins are safe, so each person's favorite movie list stays private.
